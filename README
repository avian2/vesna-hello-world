This is a small example program, demonstrating the use of libopencm3 with
the VESNA platform. It blinks the yellow LED on the VESNA core board and
continuously writes "Hello, world!" to the serial port at 19200 bauds.

To compile:

$ make

To flash using OpenOCD and Olimex ARM-USB-OCD:

$ make hello-world.u

To see the output on the serial port:

$ stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 19200
$ cat /dev/ttyUSB0

(or use your favorite serial terminal emulator)
